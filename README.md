 A computer vision project
Project Description: Object detection is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves identifying and localizing objects within an image or video. In this project, you will use convolutional neural networks (CNN) to build an object detection model that can detect and locate multiple objects within an image or video. You can use popular object detection frameworks such as YOLO (You Only Look Once) or Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) to build your model.
