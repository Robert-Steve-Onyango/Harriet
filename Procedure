Collect a dataset of images and annotate the objects within them.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Preprocess the images (e.g., resize, crop, normalize) and convert them into a format suitable for the CNN model.
Train a CNN model using the training dataset and a pre-trained CNN architecture such as VGG or ResNet.
Fine-tune the CNN model for object detection using an object detection framework such as YOLO or Faster R-CNN.
Evaluate the performance of the model using the testing dataset and metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score.
Use the trained model to detect and localize objects within new images or videos.
